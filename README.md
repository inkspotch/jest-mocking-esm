# jest-mocking-esm
trying to get the examples published by Jest to actually work for ESM

[Jest Issues](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+esm) is filled with issues involving ESM

[Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/es6-class-mocks) say they can mock ES6 classes and have a [Complete Example](https://jestjs.io/docs/es6-class-mocks#complete-example) which is what I copied here and tried to get working

The [Mocking Modules Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-functions#mocking-modules) once again make it seem like mocking things like `Axios` work "out of the box"....

[Other Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules) seem to indicate it just doesn't work:
>Please note that we currently don't support jest.mock in a clean way in ESM, but that is something we intend to add proper support for in the future. Follow this issue for updates.

I can't get the provide example to work!!  What am I doing wrong????
